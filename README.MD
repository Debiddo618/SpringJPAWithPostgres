1. Create a Spring project and download postgresql with the account setup
1. Open resources/application.properties
2. Add the following configurations

```Java
# Server configuration
server.port=8080
server.servlet.context-path=/path

# Spring Boot configuration
spring.application.name=my-spring-boot-app

# Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/students
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=postgres
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver

# JPA/Hibernate configuration
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.use_sql_comments=true
```

# Spring Configurations
- Driver Class Name: This specifies the fully qualified class name of the JDBC driver used to connect to the database. For PostgreSQL, it is org.postgresql.Driver.

- By default, Spring Boot applications run on port 8080. This configuration explicitly sets the port to 8080.

- The context path is the base URI path at which the application is accessible. For example, if the context path is set to /path, the application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080/path

- spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver: Specifies the fully qualified class name of the JDBC driver that should be used to connect to the database. When using Spring Boot to connect to a database, you need to provide the driver class name so that Spring Boot knows which JDBC driver to use for establishing database connections.

## Database Configurations
- Database URL: This specifies the JDBC URL to connect to the PostgreSQL database, including the hostname (localhost), port (5432), and database name (student).

- Username: The username used to authenticate with the database. Here, it is set to postgres.

- Password: The password used to authenticate with the database. Here, it is set to postgres.

## JPA and Hibernate Configurations
- org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect is the dialect for PostgreSQL databases. It tells Hibernate how to generate SQL optimized for PostgreSQL. Using the correct dialect ensures that Hibernate generates appropriate SQL statements for the specific database.

- spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update: This property controls the behavior of the database schema generation. The update value means that Hibernate will attempt to update the database schema to match the entity definitions each time the application is run. Also, creates the table if it does not exist.

- spring.jpa.show-sql=true: This property enables logging of the SQL statements generated by Hibernate. When set to true, Hibernate will log the SQL statements to the console, which is useful for debugging and understanding the queries being executed.

- spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true: This property enables the formatting of SQL statements. When set to true, the generated SQL statements will be formatted to make them more readable. This is particularly useful when reading logs to debug SQL issues or understand the structure of the queries.

- spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.use_sql_comments=true: This property enables the inclusion of comments in the SQL statements generated by Hibernate. When set to true, Hibernate will add comments to the SQL statements indicating the source code context from which the SQL is generated. This can be helpful for debugging and understanding the origin of specific SQL statements.
